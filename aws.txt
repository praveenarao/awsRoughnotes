Ticket / Case / incident : 


=====================================

root user : Unrestricted access on AWS account.

Least privilages Mechanism/Principle: Provide access/permissions to the user that really required to perform his job. (No less/ No addl permissions)

S3 : Simple Storage Service : AWS version of Google Drive
EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : Launch/create and manage Servers
RDS : Relational Database Service : Create and Manage Databases for our applications


S3Admin : Administarte S3 Service : root cred..???
EC2Admin : Administrate EC2 Service : root cred..??


IAM User (Identity and Access Management) : We can create users, we can manage user permissions based on their job role.

Policy : A policy is nothing but set of permissions on AWS account.

S3Admin : Attach S3FullAccess policy : When this user logs-in he can access only s3, no other servcies.
EC2Admin : Attach Ec2FullAccess policy : When this user logs-in he can access only ec2, no other servcies.

Groups : Developer group / DBA group / AWS Admin group / Support group


***Enable MFA for your root acocunt.

=======================================

Authentication : Verifying identity using Credentials (username and password)
Authorization : Defining what resources or actions specific user is allowed to access after authentication.


Implicit allow : if a user allocated with a policy i.e; s3fullaccess, the user is allowed to access only s3 service. All other servcies access are denied.

Explicit Deny : Deny overrides allow. If a user allocated with administrator access, and also, allocated with "S3 Deny".. Result : Apart from S3, user is allowed to access all the services. Even if any new service introduced.

Policy : Docuement writtens in JSON. Set of permissions on AWS env.

AWS Managed policies : Based on the AWS servcies we have in market AWS provided these.
AWS Managed job function policies : Based on stanbdard jobs we have in market. DBA / Nwtwork Admin

Customer Managed Policies : Based on customer/our requirement, we can create/modify/delete these.


Policy Components:

Service : S3, EC2, RDS : S3
Effect : Allow / Deny : Deny
Actions : S3:PutObject
Resources : S3Bucket/ EC2 Server / RDS DB : S3 Bucket Name : aviz.co.in

Requirement : I Need an IAM user, who has FullAccess on my AWS Acocunt, 
But I dont want to allow this user to work on S3 Servcie (as it contains some sensitive info).


You have an IAM user, he has multiple policies i.e; S3RwadOnly, S3FullAccess, AdministratorAccess But he also has DENYS3 Policy..!!!  Can he access S3 or not.?? 

Ans : You allow 100 times, but deny 1 time.. Deny will take effect.


I need an IAM user, I want this user to access bucket name starts with "a".

Need list permisisons, 


an IAM user can have max of 20 policies.
