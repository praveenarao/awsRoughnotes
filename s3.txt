S3 : Simple Storage service

Object based storage : Flat files : Objects : S3

------

Stores in S3-Standard Storage Class

S3 Standard : Frequently accessed Data (Default storage class) : Access without delay : phone : (3 copies across diff AZs in selected region)

S3 Standard - IA (Infrequently Accessed) : Less freq acessed data : Access without delay : laptop (3 copies across diff AZs in selected region) : 99.9%

S3 OneZone - IAM : Less freq acessed data : Access without delay : laptop (Data stores in only 1 AZ across multiple devices) : 99.5%

S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval : Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds : 

S3 Glacier Flexible Archieval : For less freq accessed data : We need to initialise the restoration to access the data : Restoration takes min-hours.. 

S3 Glacier Deep Archieval : For less freq accessed data : We need to initialise the restoration to access the data : Restoration takes atleast 12+ hours.. 

S3 Intelligent Tier : if you are not sure about data access patterns.. $$$..

---

Glacier has 3 Retrival/restore options : 
Bulk : 5-12 hrs
Standard : 3-5 Hrs
Expedited : 1-5 Min (Ob size not exceed 250 MB)

---
Versioning : 

AWS maintains multiple copies of data.

--> If any file deleted, we can get it back by deleting delete marker.
--> If any file overwridden, we can get it to valid state by deleting the wrong data version.

Permanently delete : No option to get it back.
delete : There is an option to get it back.

Delete the delete marker to get uyour object back to s3 bucket (set version : show)

LCR / Life Cycle management Rule : 



======

http status codes:

2XX : OK/Success
3XX : Redirection
4XX : Client Side 
5XX : Server Side


==========================


Encryption : helps to secure data. Plain text convertes as scrambled text/cypher text for security purpose. It uses KeyMaterial / Encryption keys (Public Key and Private Key)

---

In-Transite Encryption : Whenever data is in flight state/trasfering/transit state, we call it as In-transite encryption. Applying SSL/TLS certificate is AWS responsibility.

---

Server Side Encryption / SSE :

SSE-S3 : Amazon S3 managed keys : S3 generates and manages the key material. 
Who can decrypt data: Whoever has access to S3, can decrypt and access the data.

--- 

SSE-KMS Key Management Service

SSE-KMS AWS Managed Keys (DMK - Default master key) (aws/s3) : This generates by defautly whenever youa re using the service.. We cannot delete this.. 
AWS KMS generates and manages the key material.. Whoever has access to S3 platform, they can decrypt.

---

SSE-KMS CMK (Customer Managed keys) : COST-US : User have to generate this key.. Key material Managed by AWS KMS Service.. Along with the Service access, user should have KMS KEY USAGE permissions.. 
We can Disable/Delete the key.

Step 1 : Chopose "Symmetric"
Step 2 : Add Name and Tags
Step 3 : Add Key Administrators
Step 4 : Add key Usage permissions
Step 5 : Review and Create

---

SSE-C (Customer provided keys) : COST-US : User have to generate this key.. Key material can be provided by CUSTOMER.. Along with the Service access, user should have KMS KEY USAGE permissions.. 
We can Disable/Delete the key.

Step 1 : Chopose "Symmetric"
Step 2 : Add Name and Tags
Step 3 : Add Key Administrators
Step 4 : Add key Usage permissions
Step 5 : Review and Create

Step 6 : Download the Key wrapper
Step 7 : Wrap your keys, Zip it and upload it to KMS. 

---

Client Side Encryption / CSE: Purely customer's responsibility. Customer can encrypt his data in his local environment and can upload/manage data into s3 platform.


=============

Bucket Policies : We can generate and apply polocies at bucket level to control access or to limit to specific operations.

-> JSON format

Bucket ARN (Amazon Resource Name) : arn:aws:s3:::avinash-reddy
Principal :  IAM User ARN : arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:user/username
Effect : allow / deny
Action to effect (allow/deny): PuObject / GeteObject / DeleteObject
**Conditions : IP Conditions / Account
 

Bucket Level Operations : Deleting bucket, enabling versioning, adding acl, adding bucket policy.
	--> Bucket ARN : arn:aws:s3:::avinash-reddy

Object Level operations : delete object, upload object, putobject
	--> arn:aws:s3:::avinash-reddy/*

==========

S3 performance:

2,500 : PUTObject per prefix
5,500 : GETObject per prefix

--> use prefixes/Folders to store the data for quick search mechanism.
--> Maintain uniqueness for your Object names.

==========

S3 Consistency Model : 

Strong Read after Write Consistency : When a new object created, we can start reading it without any delay.
Strong Consistency for Overwrite PUT and DELETE Operations : 
	--> You upload something/owerwriting, you can access it without delay.
	--> You deleted an object, When any request comes, it will return "404"

Eventual Consistency for List Operation: Newly added/deleted objects may not list immediately under list results.

==========

MultiPart Upload : Instead of uploading a very big file, we can make it small chunks/parts, and upload it to s3 bucket.

aws s3 cp largefile.mp4 s3://bucket-name/ --part-size 10MB

==========

AWS Snow Family : Without using internet, we can perform data transfer to AWS using physical devices.
